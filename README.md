# 自动对焦模块项目介绍

## 项目概述
这是一个适用于所有镜头的自动对焦模块。虽然大疆DJI已经有了成熟的商业化产品，但价格昂贵。因此，我决定自己动手制作一个，既能锻炼自己，也能为开源社区贡献一份力量。目前，B站上已经有几个类似项目的视频，但都没有开源。本项目将完全开源，不产生任何商业收入。

## 项目现状
目前项目还处于非常简陋的阶段，我的代码能力也比较弱，因此进度较为缓慢。如果你对这个项目感兴趣，并希望加入或提供指导，欢迎联系我：1207510984@qq.com。我非常期待大佬们的指导和帮助。

# Auto Focus Module Project Introduction

## Project Overview
This is an auto focus module designed for all lenses. Although DJI has already developed mature commercial products, they are expensive. Therefore, I decided to create my own version, which not only helps me improve my skills but also contributes to the open-source community. Currently, there are several similar projects on Bilibili, but none of them are open-source. This project will be fully open-source and will not generate any commercial income.

## Project Status
The project is still in its very early stages, and my coding skills are relatively weak, so the progress is slow. If you are interested in this project and would like to join or provide guidance, please feel free to contact me at 1207510984@qq.com. I am looking forward to the guidance and help from experts.
